    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be fine tuning a transformer model for the **Sentiment classification** problem. **Sentiment classification** is a special case of **Multiclass Classification**. In this case the classes represent the sentiment represented by the text.\n",
    "The number of classes are generally lesser than a standard multiclass classification proboem where the classes represent the polarity, in form of `postive`, `negative` and in some cases and additional `neutral` polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most common business problems when trying to ascertain the sentiment of a statement made by your customer in a business setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* As with all the tutorials previously, this notebook also follows a easy to follow steps. Making the process of fine tuning and training a Transformers model a straight forward task.\n",
    "* However, unlike the other notebooks, in the tutorial, most of the sections have been created into functions, and they are called from the `main()` in the end of the notebook. \n",
    "* This is done to leverage the [Weights and Biases Service](https://www.wandb.com/) WandB in short.\n",
    "* It is a experiment tracking, parameter optimization and artifact management service. That can be very easily integrated to any of the Deep learning or Machine learning frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be divided into separate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used. This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Preparing Environment and Importing Libraries](#section01)\n",
    "2. [Pre-Processing and Preparing the Dataset for data processing: Class](#section02)\n",
    "3. [Defining a Model/Network](#section07)\n",
    "4. [Fine Tuning the Model: Function](#section03)\n",
    "5. [Validating the Model Performance: Function](#section04)\n",
    "6. [Main Function](#section05)\n",
    "    * [Initializing WandB](#section501)\n",
    "    * [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section502)\n",
