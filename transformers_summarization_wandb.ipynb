    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be fine tuning a transformer model for **Summarization Task**. \n",
    "In this task a summary of a given article/document is generated when passed through a network. There are 2 types of summary generation mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Extractive Summary:*** the network calculates the most important sentences from the article and gets them together to provide the most meaningful information from the article.\n",
    "2. ***Abstractive Summary***: The network creates new sentences to encapsulate maximum gist of the article and generates that as output. The sentences in the summary may or may not be contained in the article. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be generating ***Abstractive Summary***. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* As with all the tutorials previously, this notebook also follows a easy to follow steps. Making the process of fine tuning and training a Transformers model a straight forward task.\n",
    "* However, unlike the other notebooks, in the tutorial, most of the sections have been created into functions, and they are called from the `main()` in the end of the notebook. \n",
    "* This is done to leverage the [Weights and Biases Service](https://www.wandb.com/) WandB in short.\n",
    "* It is a experiment tracking, parameter optimization and artifact management service. That can be very easily integrated to any of the Deep learning or Machine learning frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be divided into separate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used. This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Preparing Environment and Importing Libraries](#section01)\n",
    "2. [Preparing the Dataset for data processing: Class](#section02)\n",
    "3. [Fine Tuning the Model: Function](#section03)\n",
    "4. [Validating the Model Performance: Function](#section04)\n",
    "5. [Main Function](#section05)\n",
    "    * [Initializing WandB](#section501)\n",
    "    * [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section502)\n",
    "    * [Creation of Dataset and Dataloader](#section503)\n",

    "    - This notebook uses one of the most recent and novel transformers model ***T5***. [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)    \n",
    "    - ***T5*** in many ways is one of its kind transformers architecture that not only gives state of the art results in many NLP tasks, but also has a very radical approach to NLP tasks.\n",
    "    - **Text-2-Text** - According to the graphic taken from the T5 paper. All NLP tasks are converted to a **text-to-text** problem. Tasks such as translation, classification, summarization and question answering, all of them are treated as a text-to-text conversion problem, rather than seen as separate unique problem statements.\n",
    "    - **Unified approach for NLP Deep Learning** - Since the task is reflected purely in the text input and output, you can use the same model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process to ANY task. Above framework can be used for any task - show Q&A, summarization, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "<a id='section501'></a>\n",
    "#### Initializing WandB \n",
    "\n",
    "* The `main()` begins with initializing WandB run under a specific project. This command initiates a new run for each execution of this command. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Before we proceed any further i will give a brief overview of the **[WandB Service](https://www.wandb.com/)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This service has been created to track ML experiments, Optimize the experiments and save artifacts. It is designed to seamlessly integrate with all the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Frameworks. Each script can be organized into *Project* and each execution of the script will be registered as a *run* in the respective project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The service can be configured to log several default metrics, such a network weights, hardware usage, gradients and weights of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It can also be used to log user defined metrics, such a loss in the `train()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This particular tutorial is logged in the project: **[transformers_tutorials_summarization](https://app.wandb.ai/abhimishra-91/transformers_tutorials_summarization?workspace=user-abhimishra-91)**\n",

    "![](meta/wandb.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit the project page to see the details of different runs and what information is logged by the service. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Following the initialization of the WandB service we define configuration parameters that will be used across the tutorial such as `batch_size`, `epoch`, `learning_rate` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These parameters are also passed to the WandB config. The config construct with all the parameters can be optimized using the Sweep service from WandB. Currently, that is outof scope of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Next we defining seed values so that the experiment and results can be reproduced.\n",

    "* We are using the `Adam` optimizer for our project. This has been a standard for all our tutorials and is something that can be changed updated to see how different optimizer perform with different learning rates. \n",

    "<a id='section505'></a>\n",

    "* As defined in the validation function, the model weights are not updated. We use the fine tuned model to generate new summaries based on the article text.\n",
    "* An output is printed on the console giving a count of how many steps are complete after every 100th step. \n",
    "* The original summary and generated summary are converted into a list and returned to the main function. \n",
    "* Both the lists are used to create the final dataframe with 2 columns **Generated Summary** and **Actual Summary**\n",

    "New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) Union minister Vijay Goel today batted for the unification of the three municipal corporations in the national capital saying a discussion over the issue was pertinent. The BJP leader, who was confident of a good show by his party in the MCD polls, the results of which will be declared tomorrow, said the civic bodies needed to be \"revamped\" in order to deliver the services to the people more effectively. The first thing needed was a discussion on the unification of the three municipal corporations and there should also be an end to the practice of sending Delhi government officials to serve in the civic bodies, said the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports. \"Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged,\" he said, referring to the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations. The erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC by the then Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government in 2012. Goel predicted a \"thumping\" victory for the BJP in the MCD polls. He said the newly-elected BJP councillors will be trained on the functioning of the civic bodies and dealing with the bureaucracy. \n",

    "New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) The Income Tax department has issued a Rs 24,646 crore tax demand notice to Sahara Groups Aamby Valley Limited (AVL) after conducting a special audit of the company. The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it. A Sahara Group spokesperson confirmed the development to PTI. \"Yes, the Income Tax Department has raised Rs 48,085.79 crores to the income of the Aamby Valley Limited with a total demand of income tax of Rs 24,646.96 crores on the Aamby Valley Limited,\" the spokesperson said in a brief statement. Officials said the notice was issued by the taxman in January this year after the special audit of AVLs income for the Assessment Year 2012-13 found that the parent firm had allegedly floated a clutch of Special Purpose Vehicles whose incomes were later accounted on the account of AVL as they were merged with the former in due course of time. The AVL, in its income return filed for AY 2012-13, had reflected a loss of few crores but the special I-T audit brought up the added income, a senior official said. The Supreme Court, last week, had asked the Bombay High Courts official liquidator to sell the Rs 34,000 crore worth of properties of Aamby Valley owned by the Sahara Group and directed its chief Subrata Roy to personally appear before it on April 28.  \n",
